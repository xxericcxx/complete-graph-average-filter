# Pinkdev - M. Couprie and L. Najman
#

Pinkdev aims at facilitating the development of your first image
processing operators. Documentation is available in ./doc, in the file
tutorialEnglish.html. If this file is not present, you can compile it
with 'make doc'. You can compile the example with 'make'. And if you
want, you can clean the directories (i.e., remove whatever is not
useful) with 'make clean'.

Any problem should be reported to
